<h1>Wildflowers</h1>
<h2>KG Munro</h2>
<p> 
Creativity is the seed of life</br>
We are the hands that sow</br> 
Through our stories and words</br>
From various parts of our blue planet</br>
I wish for fellow poets and creators</br>
To plant more seeds of honesty</br>
Because telling the truth is timeless </br>
In order for us to grow,</br>
We must exist as if we are wildflowers </br>
Growing in the same soil </br>
Using our imagination to turn our differences </br>
into a rainbow </br>
Through talking, writing, petitions, performance, and more</br>
The hope that I harbor for participatory art is this:</br>
That we can heal society and continue the creative legacy.</br>
