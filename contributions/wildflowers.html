        <h2>Wildflowers</h2>
        <h2>KG Munro</h2>
        <p> Creativity is the seed of life</br>
        We are the hands that sow</br> 
        Through our stories and words</br>
        From various parts of our blue planet</br>
        I wish for fellow poets and creators</br>
        To plant more seeds of honesty</br>
        Because telling the truth is timeless </br>
        In order for us to grow,</br>
        We must exist as if we are wildflowers </br>
        Growing in the same soil </br>
        Using our imagination to turn our differences </br>
        into a rainbow </br>
        Through talking, writing, petitions, performance, and more</br>
        The hope that I harbor for participatory art is this:</br>
        That we can heal society and continue the creative legacy.</br></p></main></html>
