<h1>A Manifesto for Gathering Garden</h1> 
<h2>Lucy Jefferies</h2> 
<p>
The ground must be levelled before anything can grow</br>
Plant seeds conscientiously, think about what is possible with the conditions you have</br> 
Always exchange; never take from the soil, without offering back </br>
Toil alongside, show your fragilities and ask for help </br>
Be patient, go slow, take your time – replant, reshape and try again </br>
Show radical tolerance - somethings will always grow wild </br>
Question your green fingers – whose prints are being left on the land? </br>
Take time to be proud and loud about the fruits of your labour and the nurturing value of the work you do </br>
Leave space for your own struggles, watering and growth</br>
