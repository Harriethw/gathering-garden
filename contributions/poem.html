<div>
    <p>
For participatory arts to flourish and grow</br>

It must become like a dandelion</br>

where one seed lands, later thousands sow</br>
</p>

<p>
To overtake rubble from the space between stones</br>

Peaking through abandoned pub gardens</br>

protruding from cracks in the patios</br>
</p>

<p>
Underneath railway bridges with no light below</br>

In graveyards and maternity ward car parks</br>

Among neglected things by the side of the road</br>
</p>

<p>
Inside demolished factories where nobody shows</br>

and fences and locked gates are all that is known

and in all other places, people no longer go
